You are a web developer and have been interested in
mobile development for years but haven't had the time or motivation to learn it.
You know you would need to learn not only a completely new programming language 
like Objective C/Swift or Java but also a completely different set of tools and like Xcode or Android Studio.

You've got excited when different frameworks appeared in the
past like Ionic or Cordova. They promised targeting multiple mobile platforms
with just one code base, but for some reason you lost interest when you noticed
that apps created with these frameworks didn't feel exactly like a real native app.

Last year React Native appeared and you are not completely sure if you should
spend time learning it. 

Why this time would be different?

In my opinion it is certainly different. Here are some reasons why React Native is so
promising and why should at least give it a try.

**1. React Native doesn't promise one codebase shared between all platforms.**

This is where the guys at Facebook nailed it. They understood that each
platform has different looks, feels and capabilities, and we should still be
developing separate apps for each platform. They call this approach "learn once,
write anywhere". This means that the same set of developers should be able to
build applications for whatever platform they choose, without needing to learn a
completely different set of technologies and tools.

**2. React Native feels like native apps.**

With React Native you can use the standard platform components such as the
NavigatorIOS, the DatePickerIOS and the UITabBar on iOS, or the Drawer, the DatePickerAndroid
and the ProgressBarAndroid on Android. You also have access to platform specific APIs
like Async Storage, Camera, Camera Roll, Push Notifications, etc.

Here are some gifs of how React Native apps look and feel:

3. You can continue using the same apps and workflow you used for years in web development.

If you come from web development you will appreciate the workflow is quite
similar. You can use Chrome web developer tools to debug and inspect elements
and you can even have live reloading.

If you tried creating a native application in the past you might now that laying out
things in the screen is quite cumbersome. 

With React Native, laying out and styling is really easy and it is pretty much the
same as styling a web page like you are used to. You can use flexbox to build the most common UI layouts
and you can even use common web styles such as backgroundColor, margin, padding, fontSize, 
among others.

4. You already use React? You will get the hang of it two days.
Really. In just 5 minutes you will have the starter app running and in two days
you can get an app like this one.

5. You can share a good amount of code between your iOS & Android App.
Go back to point 1 explaining that apps are not going to be the same but you can
share the state or some other util functions or tiny components.
