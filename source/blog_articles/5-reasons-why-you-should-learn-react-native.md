You are a web developer and you have been are interested in
mobile development for years but haven't had the time or motivation to learn not
only a completely new programming language like Objective C/Swift or Java
but also a completely different set of tools and like Xcode or Android Studio.

You've got excited when different frameworks appeared in the
past like Ionic or Cordova. They promised targeting multiple mobile platforms
with just one code base but for some reason you lost interest when you noticed
that apps created with these frameworks didn't feel like a real native app.

Last year React Native appeared and you are not completely sure if you should
spend time learning it. 

You wonder if this will time be different?

In my opinion it will be different. Here are some reasons why React Native is so
promising and why should at least give it a try.

1. React Native doesn't promise one codebase shared between all platforms.

2. React Native feels like native apps because it is indeed native.

Cordova or Ionic work]

Put some gifs of react native apps here.

3. You can continue using the same apps and workflow you used for years in web development.
Flexbox, CSS, Chrome inspector for debugging

4. You already use React? You will get the hang of it two days.
Really. In just 5 minutes you will have the starter app running and in two days
you can get an app like this one.

5. You can share a good amount of code between your iOS & Android App.
Go back to point 1 explaining that apps are not going to be the same but you can
share the state or some other util functions or tiny components.
